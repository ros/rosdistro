libgazebo7-dev

TO INSTALL:
gazebo
proj
pcl
fltk

pcl -> flann 
pcl - fix README, slack-desc


options:
    - try using the precompiled pacakge from alien - it has gnutls enabled (but no xvid)
    - try fixing the gnutls problem somehow - e.g. do everything manually and read the log
    - try including only the options which were not turned on by alien except for gnutls


remember - you will probably need to recompile kdenlive and other packages that depend on ffmpeg
