# This is a program to sync rosdistro source entries with the release repository devel_branch.
#
# When doing a release of a ROS package through bloom, it is possible
# to set the branch in the rosdistro 'source' entry different from the
# "devel_branch" that is used in the release repository.  This is
# not recommended, as doing further releases will now cause bloom
# to look at the "wrong" branch for tags.  The situation gets even
# worse since both the rosdistro 'source' entry and the devel_branch
# in the release repository can be changed by hand.
#
# Overview
# --------
# This program starts by downloading the distribution.yaml file for a
# given ROS distribution, e.g. https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/dashing/distribution.yaml
# In its default configuration, it will also download https://github.com/ros2/ros2/blob/master/ros2.repos
# in order to determine the "core" ROS 2 packages.  After finding the core packages,
# it will then go to the release repository for each package, and check to ensure that
# the devel_branch is the same as the branch listed on the rosdistro source entry.
# If they are different, it will open a pull request against the release
# distribution to synchronize them.
# Note that this program can produce false positives in corner cases, which is why it
# opens pull requests and doesn't directly push to the repositories.  The pull requests it
# generates should be carefully reviewed before merging.
#
# Dependencies
# ------------
# Besides the basic Python 3 dependency, this program relies on two external packages:
#  * https://pypi.org/project/PyGithub/
#  * https://pypi.org/project/keyring/
#
# Credentials
# -----------
# In order to do the work that it does, this program needs Github credentials in order to open pull requests.
# In the Github developer settings, create a new Personal Access Token that has full access to the `repo`
# permission and all sub-permissions.  When the token is created and it gives you a password, locally run:
#
# keyring set github-open-prs may-open-prs
#
# When it asks for a password, give it the token
#
# Usage
# -----
# usage: sync-ros-gbp-devel-branch.py [-h] [--all-repos] [--dry-run]
#                                     distribution
#
# positional arguments:
#   distribution  Which ROS distribution to do the sync for
#
# optional arguments:
#   -h, --help    show this help message and exit
#   --all-repos   Check all repositories, not just core ROS 2 ones
#   --dry-run     Just print the differences, do not actually open PRs
