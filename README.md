# The L-CAS ROS distribution

**This repo is a fork of the original ROS repo!**

**The documentation below is from the upstream repository. Generally, the rules also apply here, but this distribution is maintained by L-CAS, the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems, and drives our own build farm.**


---

This repo maintains the lists of repositories defining ROS distributions.

It is the implementation of [REP 143](http://ros.org/reps/rep-0143.html)

It also the home of the rosdep rules.
