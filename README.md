A Quick Overview of How to Use this Repository
----------------------------------------------

To add your project to our build farm, fork this repository, modify the .yaml files, and give us a pull request.
For Fuerte and older the ROS packages are maintained in the subfolder ``releases`` and ``doc``.
For Groovy and newer the ROS packages are maintained in the subfolder named after the ROS distribution.
Mappings for dependencies are maintained in the ``rosdep`` subfolder.

To create jobs on our build farm to build Debian sourcedeb and binarydeb packages add your bloom (or git-buildpackage compatible) repository to the ``ROSDISTRO/release.yaml`` file (or ``releases/ROSDISTRO.yaml`` for Fuerte and older).
Please keep the alphabetic order of the list.
You can use the script ``scripts/add_release_repo.py`` to perform the insertion.

To create jobs on our build farm to perform continuous integration of your repository on every commit add your source repository to the ``ROSDISTRO/source.yaml`` file (or ``releases/ROSDISTRO-devel.yaml`` for Fuerte and older).
Please keep the alphabetic order of the list.
You can use the script ``scripts/add_devel_repo.py`` to perform the insertion.
