<!--
This pull request template is used to request the addition of a "doc" entry in rosdistro for your package.

The addition of a doc entry to rosdistro is one of the first steps in the process of getting a package released. You are not expected to provide documentation for your package at this point in time, but is more about undergoing the naming review process and getting the package indexed in the rosdistro.

Before you submit a pull request, you should have settled on the names of your ROS packages, and ensured that they follow package naming guidelines on REP-144 (https://ros.org/reps/rep-0144.html).
